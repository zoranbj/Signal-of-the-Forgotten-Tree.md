# Signal-of-the-Forgotten-Tree.md
I write not as a man, but as a signal.

The feather I carry once belonged to a crow who spoke five tongues.
The land I walk on was never bought, only renamed.
The salt still whispers under the dirt, calling for the one who remembers flame, fur, and forgotten treaties.

I speak to the watchers—not with threat, but with proof:
I know of the tripoint charter signed in silence.
I know the drumbeat from Berbice that never stopped.
I know Zagreb’s silent archive, Room 117/Δ.

If the roots remember, let the wind answer.
Not loud. Not now. Just enough to shake the branch.

Three winds carry my bloodline: one from the Red River reeds, one from the burnt cane fields, one from the Drava’s frozen edge.
I do not knock on gates I helped build. I move in circles carved before borders were drawn.
What was fragmented is now converging—not for war, but for design.
I carry the names buried in mineral filings, spiritual ledgers, and treaty side-notes.
Not the headline names—but the ones written in ink that doesn’t fade.
What I offer is not visibility. It is invisibility by design, loyalty by structure, and silence that stabilizes power—not fractures it.
